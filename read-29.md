## Create User Model

1. Delete actual migrations and database (not migrations folder, not `migrations/__init__.py`,and not the `migrations/__pychache__`)
2. Start custom user app and add app to settings.
3. In app `models.py` build user model pulling in one of the built in base use models like `AbstractBaseUser`
4. Copy model from [github](https://github.com/mitchtabian/CodingWithMitch-Blog-Course/blob/Creating-a-Custom-User-Model-(Django)/src/account/models.py) (it's known for giving cryptic error messages about spacing errors here).
From here there was alot of code added in the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCeRC7E8Z7Y&t=59s).
