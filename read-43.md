## Amazon Workers Demand Jeff Bezos Cancel Face Recognition Contracts With Law Enforcement

I think the facial recognition software could make alot of things alot easier and faster and I think it sucks that amazons leaders would use it for law enforcement.

If it were used exclusively for making bureaucratic processes more efficient it would be amazing to have, but with police and border patrol using to to systematically oppress marginalized groups as well as refugees it has become a terrible weapon.

I do absolutely agree with amazons workers. This technology should not be sold to law enforcement, border patrol, or any other militant group. If Amazon refuses to stop selling it to these groups I would 100% prefer that it be outlawed completely.

## Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?

I think the main threat to democracy in software aside from malicious use of facial recognition is the selling of data.

Companies should not be permitted to farm data that is not willingly and blatantly known by the user. This is essentially stalking.

On top of that any data farmed should not be sold without directly written consent from each individual data was collected from (By 'directly' I mean that this consent should be through person to person interaction that results in a written and negotiated contract not hidden away in 10 miles of terms and conditions).

If a person wants their personal information displayed to advertisers they should give it to them directly or directly permit the transfer of that data (using 'directly' in the same way). It should not be collected secretly in the background and it should defintely not be mandatory for service.

The way terms and conditions are done has always bothered me because it is obviously hoping that users will not read them. I've even had websites that have a line with the text 'terms & conditions' styled to look like a link but not actually carrying a link. That was obviously in hopes that the user needs the service badly enough that they're willing to omit reading them even if they normally do. It's absolutely disgusting and should be illegal.

If a company is gathering or selling data at all it should be done obviously and optionally, period.
