# Interview Tips

## Whiteboard

Restate the question - Ensures you fully understand the question and gives time to think it through.

Ask about edge cases - Ask if there's a specific way I should handle edge cases or if it's up to me for interview purposes.

Ask about test cases - This could be expected or a bonus. Either way it's a good practice.

Write pseudo-code and ask if it makes sense - Not writing pseudo-code first could lead to difficulty remembering/finding next steps. It also presents the potential for free help finding the best solution and shows you're open to accepting feedback.

Write the actual code and ask if it looks good - If you have syntax errors you should be able to ask about them. If they give you grief just say you'll leave it as pseudo-code for now and come back to it when the rest of the code is complete to ensure you have enough time.

## Programming

Take a minute - Ask if you can take a minute or 2 to think through the problem if you need to. There's a big difference between filling the silence and speaking intelligently on the problem.

Don't sweat the small stuff - Don't forget that the point is to show depth and breadth of knowledge not perfect syntax every time.

Sit down. Be humble - Don't forget this isn't just about coding prowess they want to see if they're willing to work with you asa person too.

Com prepared - Ask if there's anything you should study in preparation for the interview or any tools you'll be expected to use. Research and practice common interview questions if possible.

Review your work - Remember maintenance is important in the coding world and seeing you drop the mic after your first attempt could look like you don't care and could leave you with disfunctional code.
