## In Tests We Trust -- TDD with Python

TDD - Test Driven Development (write tests first then write code to pass tests).
AAA - Arrange(bring in necessary info), Act(run code), Assert(test result against expected result).
STEPS: Write the test, Write the feature, Refactor the code.
  - So the idea is more to get the test passing however you see fit then write another test to make it fail while still getting a usable result.

## Recursion

Recursion - The act of a function calling itself either directly(the function being called within itself) or indirectly(the function being called within a function it calls).
  - I think I've actually used this before to have a set of functions check data to make sure we're getting exactly what we need and continuing to modify the result if we don't.
Tail Recursion - When the recursive call is the last thing performed by the function.
Recursive functions require more memory space and time to complete.
