## Big O

O(1) time - Amount of time taken to complete action does not change regardless of action size.
O(1) space - Amount of space does not change regardless of amount of time taken?
O(n) time - Amount of time taken to complete action increases as action size increases and vise versa.
O(n) space - Amount of space taken increases as amount of time taken to cmplete increases and vise versa?
O(a*b) - EXAMPLE: loop in a loop (iterates through indices in an array and through all arrays in a matrix).

IRRELEVENT:
  - Are linked lists what file structures are made of? To me it seems like a directory or file only knows it's value and next/previous reference address and that sounds exactly like a doubly linked list.
