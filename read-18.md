A ceasar cypher was using the 5th character after the one you want to use (to use 'a' type 'g', to use 'b' type 'h' and so on down the alphabet as shown below).
```
to use: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
type:   GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEF
meaning:    SECRET
typed word: YKIXKZ
```

Since 'e' is the most commonly used letter in the english language if the cypher was made to translate to english we can look for the most common letter on the page and assume what the remaining letters might be based on the number and order of characters as well as the surrounding words.
